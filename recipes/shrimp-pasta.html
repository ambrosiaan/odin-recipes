    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The sauce in this amazing Indonesian curry might be invisible, but you'll know it's there. As it reduces, the
        water evaporates, leaving behind the fat and flavor that make this dish so unique and addictive. Originally,
        cooking meat this way helped preserve it in hot and
        humid Indonesia. Turns out, people continued making it long after refrigeration came around. Serve with steamed
        rice, garnished with cilantro and lime if desired.

            Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sugar snap peas in hot oil until
            tender, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and red pepper; continue to cook until the shrimp are bright pink on the
            outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir basil sauce into the
            shrimp mixture and remove from heat; spoon over spaghetti to serve.
